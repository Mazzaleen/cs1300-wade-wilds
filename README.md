# Context/Problem 
## What problem does this solve? Why should we care?
This react application contains a portfolio for a aspiring software engineering college student studying computer science and economics.
It is pirate themed in order to achieve it's goal of engagement
As a student, how can i display my information for potential employers? 

# Research/Feedback
## What precedent work is out there? Who is our audience? What do they want/think?
No precedent work out there besides existing json files and assets and animations, audience are employers or fellow students, we want them to easily retain information from the website 




# Design Iterations (with justification)
## What are the tradeoffs? Explain your design decisions. 
Utilizing typescript was a continuation of the learning i made on the previous project. I Also genearlly discovered that it made things very easy for me to compartemntalize my data for seperation of concern. For example, creating a components library aided me in styling all my cards so i can add them easily to the page by just instanitating them as interfaces. I also learned about using scss over css and the added benefits i ended up discovering when trying to see how i can edit my code. I was able to actually leverage this existing information and basically design a ui folder that easily allows me to quickly change colors across the entire website 

# Conclusion
## What are your lessons learned, insights, takeaways, etc.?
Typescript is fucking king, and scss > css. I think for my own personal website im going to use the libraries visited here to enhance the website i already have. I also realized the impoirtance of components and seperate Data files

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `Context/Problem

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
